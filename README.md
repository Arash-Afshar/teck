SDCC experiments
================

This branch is dedicated to implementing lots of small subroutines
using the Small Device C Compiler, with the primary goal to acquire
some general feel of how things work in C, and secondary to collect a
set of subroutines for use in a Free firmware for the Truly Ergonomic
keyboard.

See narration in the [project wiki][].
